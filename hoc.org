* Scientific Papers as Code
** Prose as Programmable Data
We could start with using Pollen which is a wonderful means to generate code in the pollen markdown language and thus compile the same content into multiple formats.

* Why House of Cards?
** Abstract
“What we truly understand, we never forget” 
It is our strong belief that contextual learning is the best form of learning which leads to deeper understanding and insights on the subject matter.


Roadmap
•	We build on these stories using a Deck of Cards.
•	Algorithms could be based on simple stories about personified cards. 
•	Modelling card games using the modern software development techniques.
